- 👋 Hi, I’m @V37715
- 👀 I’m interested in 
    * PHP/Laravel
    * NodeJS/Express/ts
    * React
    * Vue
    * AWS
- I'm especially interested in event based (microservice) architecture and work queues such as Beanstalkd
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new stuff as I go, because current workload doensn't leave much time for dedicated (e-)learning.
      That being said, I'm looking forward to have more balanced workload again in the near future, so that I can allocate more time
      for learning new cool stuff! B-) After all, it's one of the best parts of this trade.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: projects given to me by my employer. :P
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me trought my employer Vincit Oy/Ltd. I'm located in Turku, Finland and 
      you should be able to reach me just by asking contacts for Vettis @ Vincit Turku => http://vincit.fi
